#### 👋 Hi, i'm Sani Mridha a React Native Developer

I’m currently dedicating most of my time with my team on Building awesome 📱 Apps. We are a team of people working hard to build innovative digital products with ❤

A React Native engineer has a great blend of JavaScript and native platform skills, making them a useful resource for any team that needs to diversify its product across multiple platforms. They know when to pursue a fully native solution, and also when to use JavaScript to maximize code reuse and understandability.
